This document describes the KDH Telco and ISP Company/Ticker Level Products developed by KASPR Datahaus PTY LTD. This suit of products presents **daily aggregates** of our few-hourly (e.g. 1h, 3h, 6h)  national level aggregates at the Internet Service Provider (ISP) level products and provide an aggregated measure of ISPâ€™s ICT Infrastructure.  It contains aggregated measures on a rgion's internet quality, outages, slow-downs and distance to latency frontier.  The raw measurement basis for this product are over 3 billion daily measurements from over 450 million internet connected end-point devices. Data is matched to stock tickers.

## Variable Defintions {.unlisted .unnumbered}

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| country_iso_three_char_code | Country's 3-digit ISO code |
| country_iso_name | Country name |
| bb_ticker | Stock Ticker |
| year | Year |
| month | Month |
| rtt_variance_norm | Average Variance in Latency (ping response time in ms). Higher values indicate more volatility in internet connectivity during that period. |
| rtt_mean_norm | Average Latency (ping response time in ms). Higher values indicate lower average quality in internet connectivity during that period. |
| connectivity_out_2sd | Indicator variable that switches to 1 if connectivity (unique # of active IPs) was 2 standard deviations below the median connectivity and 0 otherwise. |
| latency_out_3sd | Indicator variable that switches to 1 if *rtt_mean_norm* was 3 standard deviations above the median latency and 0 otherwise. |
| rtt_d	|Absolute difference between *rtt_mean_norm* and minimum latency in the country (rtt_min). Distance to the latency frontier.	Higher values indicate relatively lower quality.	|
|rtt_dp	|Percentage difference between *rtt_mean_norm*  and minimum latency in the country (rtt_min). Distance to the latency frontier.		Higher values indicate relatively lower quality.	 |
