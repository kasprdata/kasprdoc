# Global Geolocated Internet Intel & Anomaly Products

The KASPR Global Geolocated Internet Intel & Anomaly products are a suite of data on internet quality, outages and slowdowns at the hourly (1, 3, or 6) and ADM2 (e.g. county, district) level for 136 countries in the world. It contains aggregated measures of a region's ICT Infrastructure, via millions of individual internet protocol (IP) address observations measured by KASPR's proprietary monitoring technology. The raw measurement basis for this product are over 3 billion daily measurements from over 450 million internet connected end-point devices.

## Variable Definitions {.unlisted .unnumbered}

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| country_iso_three_char_code | Country's 3-digit ISO code |
| country_iso_name | Country name |
| * adm1_name | Name of the ADM1 unit. ADM1 refers to a country's first, administrative unit at the subnational level (e.g. States in the US, Bundeslaender in Germany, or Provinces in China). |
| * adm1_unique_identifier | Unique alpha-numerical identifier for the ADM1 unit. Combination of `country_iso_three_char_code` and an integer. |
| ** adm2_name | Name of the ADM2 unit. ADM2 refers to a country's second, administrative unit at the subnational level (e.g. Counties in the US, LGAs in Australia). |
| ** adm2_unique_identifier | Unique alpha-numerical identifier for the ADM2 unit. Combination of `adm1_unique_identifier` and an integer. |
| time_e | Unix timestamp |
| time_e_utc_str | Timestamp (GMT, string) |
| timezone_offset | Offset from GMT (hours) |
| timezone_name | IANA timezone name |
| time_local | Local timestamp (timezone offset applied) |
| rtt_variance_norm | Average Variance in Latency (ping response time in ms). Higher values indicate more volatility in internet connectivity during that period. |
| rtt_mean_norm | Average Latency (ping response time in ms). Higher values indicate lower average quality in internet connectivity during that period. |
| rtt_mean_norm_adj | Average Latency (ping response time in ms) adjusted to account for monthly infrastructure sampling baseline shifts. See main document for details. |
| [connectivity,latency]_indx | Unique IP counts, or mean latency, over the time period, normalised to take the value of 100 for the average of true observations considered `normal' within a long time period. See main document for details. |
| [connectivity,latency]_indx_hat | Expected unique IP counts, or expected mean latency, over the time period, normalised, based on fitted fixed-effects model for this region. See main document for details. |
| [connectivity,latency]_indx_flagL | Lower boundary of normalcy based on fitted fixed-effects model for this region ($\alpha = 0.001$). See main document for details. |
| [connectivity,latency]_indx_flagH | Upper boundary of normalcy based on fitted fixed-effects model for this region ($\alpha = 0.001$). See main document for details. |
| [connectivity,latency]_is_flag | Takes the value of 1 if the observation lies beyond the normalcy region for this measure, or 0 otherwise ($\alpha = 0.001$). |
